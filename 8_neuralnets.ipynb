    "While `sklearn` has a library for neural networks, it is very basic and not the standard in the industry. The most commonly used libraries as of 2020 are **Tensorflow** and **Pytorch**.\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow is developed by Google Brain and actively used at Google both for research and production needs. Its closed-source predecessor is called DistBelief.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch is a cousin of lua-based Torch framework which was developed and used at Facebook. However, PyTorch is not a simple set of wrappers to support popular language, it was rewritten and tailored to be fast and feel native.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an article that explains very well the difference between the two libraries: [pytorch-vs-tensorflow](https://towardsdatascience.com/pytorch-vs-tensorflow-spotting-the-difference-25c75777377b). In short, pytorch is much more intuitive for a python programmer and more user friendly. It also has a superior development and debugging experience. However, if you want more control on the fundamentals, a better community support and you need to train large models, Tensorflow is better."
